# Trajectory Optimization of Multirotors through Gates in Drone Racing using RL


This project is an attempt to use policy gradient based methods to optimize a trajectory through gates for use in drone racing. The primary endpoint is measured by reduction in snap of the trajectory while keeping it feasible.


### TODO

 - Decide with RL algorithm to use (A2C, TRPO, ACKTR, etc)
 - Implement Baseline
 - Implement learning algorithm
 - Decide NN architecture
 - Train and get results
 - Write report


### DONE
 - Create the environment 
   - Define Gym environment
   - Create reward function
